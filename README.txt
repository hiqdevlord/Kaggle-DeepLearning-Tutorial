Because I'm too lazy to put my code on github, this Dropbox is a backup place to put code for 
the deep learning tutorial.

The files are as follows:
labeledTrainData.tsv - 25,000 tab delimited labeled training reviews (with sentiment labels)
unlabeledTrainData.tsv - An addition 50,000 tab delimited training reviews with no sentiment label
testData.tsv - 25,000 tab delimited test reviews (no sentiment labels)
testData-TRUTH.csv - Sentiment labels for the test reviews
BoW.py - Code that uses bag of words and a random forest for sentiment analysis

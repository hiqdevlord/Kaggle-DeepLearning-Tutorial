#  This file contains code to accompany the Kaggle tutorial
#  "Deep learning goes to the movies".  The code in this file
#  is for Part 2 of the tutorial and covers Bag of Centroids
#  for a Word2Vec model. This code assumes that you have already
#  run Word2Vec and saved a model called "300features_40minwords_10context"
